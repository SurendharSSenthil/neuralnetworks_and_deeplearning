# Neural Networks and Deep Learning

This is a **learning repository** where I continuously push my **notes, exercises, and code** as I progress through different chapters of neural networks and deep learning.

The repository is **organized chapter-wise**, with each folder corresponding to a specific chapter or concept. It reflects my learning journey — from understanding fundamentals to implementing ideas in code.

## Structure

- Each directory represents a **chapter**
- Inside each chapter, you may find:
  - Notes (theory & explanations)
  - Practice exercises
  - Code implementations and experiments
